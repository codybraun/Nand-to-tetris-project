Project 10

This can be run from the command line with "python project10.py X.xml". 
It generates an XT.xml file and an X.xml file, which are the tokens and the parsed xml respectively. 
I sort of ran out of time, so the code is a bit of a mess, but I tried to comment out what I'm doing. 
Basically, create a list of tokens and parse everything by taking a root and a position in the list of tokens so that it can 
recurse down. Lemme know if anything isn't working , this passes all the test for me. Thanks!
