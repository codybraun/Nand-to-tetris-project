Project 9

Everything is stored in /TypingGame so you can just compile with sh JackCompiler.sh TypingGame from the project9 folder.
To play, just type the letter that you are prompted to type in the style of like one of those old Mavis Beacon games. You have to hold the letter for a second because of the quirks on Jack input, so this is actually a pretty bad way to learn to type, but you get the idea. 
The game should end when your guy (the circle) or the computer (the square) reaches the end of the screen.
