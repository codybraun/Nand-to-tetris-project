So all of the .jack files pass the tests when run seperately. There are enough minor flaws in them that they don't all run together sometimes though (division is inefficient enough that it stack overflows during some of the other tests if you use my Math.vm for example). I've just been testing each one with the rest of the provided OS. Otherwise it should be pretty self explanatory. Thanks, let me know if you have any trouble with it!
