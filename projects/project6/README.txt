Project 6

This just includes my Python source, should work on the Linux computers. 
You can run it with "python project6 file.asm" from the command line. I used the Python re library for string manipulation, hopefully that's okay. 

I probably could've gotten this done in fewer lines of code as well, particularly the logic of the comp string, but it seems to work. Let me know if there are any problems.

Thanks!
