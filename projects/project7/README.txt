Project 7
Cody Braun

Everything seems to work okay. You can run with "python project7.py xxxxx.asm or DIR"  So "python project7.py ." assembles everything in the current directory.
I think I have all the operators working efficiently, though pop and push seem like they should be shorter in some cases. 
For some reason the CPU emulator gives me a lot of trouble- this passes all comparisons but sometimes it gets stuck and I have to keep hitting the forward button.
