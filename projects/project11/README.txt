Project 11

So this sort of barely works for a few of the simple examples. My project 10 was such a mess that I had a hard time building project 11 on top of it and spent most of the week troubleshooting that. All the code is extremely ugly, sorry! You can probably see that the .vm code it outputs is mostly correct, but has enough problems that it usually crashes. 

Anyway, you can run it with "python project11.py DIRORJACKFILE"

Thanks!
